SQL vs NOSQL:


- Refreshing our main app shwed us how we cant strore it after re running



- Choosing dbms is not easy



Family in databases:

SQL: structured query language

NOSQL: not only structured query language 


SQL:
MySQQL
POSTgreSQL


NOSQL:
mongoDB
redis


Difference in structure:

sql : Grouped in tables
- can be inflexible
- example: modificiations/ specifications per user becomes difficut cause you have to create a new field for everyone
- SQL tries to square off table hence why new fields would be added and NULLS we be added folr the other one


NOSQL:
- no flexibility issues
- key value partials
- Saved as JSON 
- Can add user based moidifications no issues

Implementation of relationships:

sql: relational 
nosql: non-relational 

- Wanted to keep a record of orders 
    customer address price amount --> does not make sense to cram it all one table 
- Using sql dbms we cna relate tables to each other. We can specify/link up customer table through customer id


relationships data might be better to use SQL


One to many kinda relationship:

MOngo DB


Scalability: No sql better because it is more scalable than sql database 





MYSQL vs mongoDB
mature vs shiny and new 
Table structure vs Doc structure
Requires a Schema vs More Flexible to Changes
Great with Relationships  vs Not great with Relationships
Scales Vertically cs Horizontally Scalable
